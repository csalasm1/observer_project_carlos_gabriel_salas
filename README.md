## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and is organized into three main modules:

### 📦 Project Structure

```
ObserverProject/
├── incident-sdk/          # Reusable observability SDK library
├── design-system/         # UI component library (Atomic Design)
└── app/                   # Android application module
```

### 🔧 Technical Architecture

#### **Incident SDK (`incident-sdk`)**
- **Clean Architecture Layers**:
  - **Public API**: `IncidentTracker` singleton, configuration classes
  - **Internal Domain**: Core business logic, repository pattern
  - **Storage Layer**: Pluggable storage implementations (Room-based)

- **Key Components**:
  - `IncidentTracker`: Thread-safe singleton facade
  - `IncidentRepository`: Data aggregation and business logic
  - `RoomIncidentStorage`: Room-based persistence with FIFO eviction

#### **Design System (`design-system`)**
- **Atomic Design Pattern**:
  - **Atoms**: Colors, typography, shapes, spacing
  - **Molecules**: Buttons, headers, navigation bars
  - **Organisms**: Complete screen layouts

- **Theme System**: Centralized design tokens with light/dark theme support

#### **Application (`app`)**
- **MVVM + Clean Architecture**:
  - **Presentation**: ViewModels with StateFlow, Jetpack Compose UI
  - **Domain**: Use Cases for business logic encapsulation
  - **Data**: Repository pattern (direct SDK usage)

### 🎯 Key Technical Decisions

#### **Observability SDK Design**
- **Singleton Pattern**: `IncidentTracker` ensures single instance across the app
- **Fail-Fast Initialization**: Clear error messages if SDK not initialized
- **Thread Safety**: Mutex-based synchronization and `@Volatile` fields
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Non-blocking incident tracking with background coroutines
- **Storage Abstraction**: Pluggable storage (currently Room-only with FIFO eviction)

#### **UI Architecture**
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI with unidirectional data flow
- **StateFlow**: Reactive UI state management
- **Hilt DI**: Dependency injection for ViewModels and Use Cases
- **Atomic Design**: Reusable, composable UI components
- **Material 3**: Modern design system with dynamic theming

#### **Data Flow & State Management**
- **Reactive Streams**: Flow/StateFlow for real-time incident updates
- **Use Case Pattern**: Clean separation of business logic from ViewModels
- **Repository Pattern**: Centralized data access abstraction

#### **Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for SDK core logic (31 tests)
- **Fake Storage**: In-memory implementation for isolated testing
- **Coroutine Testing**: `UnconfinedTestDispatcher` for immediate execution
- **Thread Safety**: Verified concurrent operation correctness

#### **Performance Considerations**
- **Background Processing**: Coroutines on `Dispatchers.IO` for storage operations
- **Lazy Initialization**: Room database singleton pattern
- **Memory Management**: Configurable incident limits with automatic cleanup
- **UI Optimization**: `collectAsState()` and `SharedFlow` for efficient updates

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Real-time Incident Tracking**: Monitor app incidents with configurable metadata
- **📈 Interactive Dashboard**: Time-based charts with filtering (15/30/60/90 minutes)
- **🎨 Design System**: Consistent UI components with light/dark theme support
- **🔧 Configurable Storage**: Room-based persistence with size limits
- **🚀 Crash Simulation**: Safe crash testing in debug builds only
- **📱 Responsive UI**: Modern Material 3 design with Jetpack Compose
- **🧪 Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit test coverage for SDK reliability

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- **SDK Initialization**: Must be called in `Application.onCreate()` before any tracking
- **Thread Safety**: All public SDK methods are thread-safe and non-blocking
- **Storage Limits**: Configurable max incidents with automatic oldest-first removal
- **Debug Features**: Crash simulation only works in debug builds
- **Navigation**: Compose Navigation with bottom bar integration

## 🚧 Next Steps

To continue evolving the SDK and improve scalability and user insights:

### 📌 SDK Optimization for Large-Scale Data

- Implement **direct SQLite filtering queries**, avoiding loading all incidents into memory before filtering.  
  This drastically reduces overhead for queries like date ranges, severities, or screen names.

- Add a **pagination layer for date-based browsing**, preventing heavy retrieval when the database grows.  
  This allows the dashboard to load incidents incrementally and remain performant.

- Add **userId and segmentation support** in the incident model, enabling filtering by user properties commonly used in analytics and experimentation platforms.

### 📊 Tracing & Funnel Analytics

- Implement **traces** to track how users move through the dashboard and navigation layers.  
- Build a **funnel visualization feature** to measure conversion (e.g., from viewing incidents → filtering → drilling into detail).

These additions will make the SDK not only an observability tool but a **behavioral analytics platform**.

## 📝 Mini Postmortem

While implementing the real-time dashboard, the goal was for it to **react live to database changes**.  
However, this only made sense if incidents could also be **created directly from the dashboard**.

When I started adding incident-creation actions in the UI, I realized the ViewModels were filling up with **boilerplate code**, because each ViewModel needed to call the tracking SDK manually.

This led to an important architectural realization:

> I needed to cleanly encapsulate incident creation behind a **Use Case**, instead of calling the SDK from every ViewModel.

By introducing a dedicated `TrackIncidentUseCase`, I:

- Centralized the logic  
- Reduced coupling  
- Removed repeated code  
- Made event tracking callable from anywhere with a simple, clean API  

This significantly improved maintainability and highlighted why **use cases are essential in Clean Architecture**, especially when dealing with shared resources like SDKs.
